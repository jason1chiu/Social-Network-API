## Description
My motivation was to create a scalable and efficient social network API that can handle large amounts of unstructured data. I built this project to provide a robust foundation for social networking platforms, catering to their data-driven requirements. This project solves the challenge of managing large volumes of unstructure data while ensuring fast and flexible options in a social network application. I learned how to build a full-fledged API using Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose, while also implementing various CRUD operations and handling complex relationships between different data models.

## Installation
1. Ensure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) installed on your local machine.
2. Clone or download the project repository from GitHub using HTTPS or SSH into a folder of your choice
3. In the project directory, run "npm install" to install all required dependencies.
4. Start the MongoDB server by running mongod or mongo depending on your system.
5. Launch the application by running "npm start" or "node server.js" from the project directory.
6. Use a REST API client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest), or [Postman](https://www.postman.com) to interact with the API endpoints.


## Usage
To explore the full list of available endpoints and CRUD operations, please refer to the video walkthrough provided in the [Test](#test) section. The API operations include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. Ensure that you replace the respective IDs for users, thoughts, friends and reactions accurately when performing specific actions, such as retrieving a single user, or adding a friend to another user. The video demonstration showcases both successful and unsuccessful requests, as well as the correct format for the JSON payload required for certain requests. Be cautious of extra spaces in the JSON payload, as they may lead to errors; always double-check your payload to prevent such issues.
